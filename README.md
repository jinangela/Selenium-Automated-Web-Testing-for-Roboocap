# Selenium-Automated-Web-Testing-for-Roboocap
These Python scripts used Selenium to do automated web testing for the web application Roboocap. The testing includes uploading files to
roboocap.com, checking the production schedule and shipment, adding orders from shopping cart, etc.

www.roboocap.com is an Internet entrance where people can have access to 3D printing, laser cutting and CNC manufacturing services without
investment by uploading standard 3D design files to the roboocap manufacturing cloud.
